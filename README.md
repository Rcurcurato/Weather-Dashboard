# Module 6 Challenge

## Weather Dashboard

## Motivation
    I decided to make this weather dashboard using web apis because
    I love keeping up on current weather and think it's a good tool 
    for others to use too. I also wanted to create this weather dashboard
    to help me learn what web api's are all about. 

## Function
    Here you will find a website that uses web api's so when the user searches
    for a city, they will be presented with the current weather and the 5 day
    forecast. The data that will be presented will be data such as temperature,
    windspeed, and humidity.
